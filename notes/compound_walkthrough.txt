===  Basic Operations and conjunctions

---  basic 'And' is intersection, 'Intersect'

whole file set:  (foo.cs, bar.cs, baz.cs)
when /a/
    gives whole file set to match
    match /a/
        takes SourceFiles (foo.cs, bar.cs, baz.cs)
        returns List<IssueSet> (foo.cs:3;5, bar.cs:10;22)
    sets progress to result from match /a/
and  /b/  (foo.cs, bar.cs)
    gives progress to match
    match /b/
        takes SourceFiles (foo.cs, bar.cs)
        returns List<IssueSet> (bar.cs:10;77;99)
    sets progress to intersection of progess and result of match /b/ (bar.cs:10)


---  basic 'Or' is union, 'Add'

whole file set:  (foo.cs, bar.cs, baz.cs)
when /a/
    gives whole file set to match
    match /a/
        takes SourceFiles (foo.cs, bar.cs, baz.cs)
        returns List<IssueSet> (foo.cs:23;144)
    sets progress to result from match /a/
or   /b/  (foo.cs, bar.cs)
    gives whole file set to match
    match /b/
        takes SourceFiles (foo.cs, bar.cs, baz.cs)
        returns List<IssueSet> (foo.cs:23;25, bar.cs:22)
    sets progress to union of progess and result of match /b/ (foo.cs:23;25,144, bar.cs:22)


---  basic 'AndNot' is subtraction, 'Subtract'

whole file set:  (foo.cs, bar.cs, baz.cs)
when   /a/
    gives whole file set to match
    match /a/
        takes SourceFiles (foo.cs, bar.cs, baz.cs)
        returns List<IssueSet> (foo.cs:3;5, bar.cs:10;22)
    sets progress to result from match /a/
andnot /b/  (foo.cs, bar.cs)
    gives progress to match
    match /b/
        takes SourceFiles (foo.cs, bar.cs)
        returns List<IssueSet> (bar.cs:10;77;99)
    subtracts result of match /b/ from progress (foo.cs:3;5, bar.cs:22)


---  basic 'OrNot' makes no sense, or is arguably also subtraction.
    * If subtraction, it's equivalent to AndNot.
    * Sedulous misconstrual could contrive it to be the union of the complement of the match.

===  Scoping

---  Basics of scoping

    Language and FilePattern criteria are scoped to the file.  The file does or does not match as a whole.
    ContentPattern criteria are scoped to each line they match on.  A ContentPattern might match five times in one file.

    If necessary, a ContentPattern can be overridden to be file scoped, by adding Scope="file" to the ContentPattern element.  This is useful for cases where one mention of a piece of code means that the entire file needs rewriting, or where one mention of a piece of code means that a possible problem indicated by other matches has been entirely fixed.

---  nesting
