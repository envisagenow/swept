Swept was developed while I worked at Envisage Technologies, and released as open source with their permission.  Success always brings new problems.  At Envisage, the success and growth of our product and team brought the communication costs and gaps that Swept is intended to reduce.  Thanks!

Casey Kramer put an initial proof of concept together, after I belabored him with this idea once too often.  That sent me from scheming into coding--thanks?  :D

When Visual Studio had beaten me down twice, in my attempts to attach my smoothly-ticking code to its... entertainingly diverse... extensibility mechanisms, Ben Kleptz grabbed a machete and helped me through the first, gnarliest thicket.  The momentum gain from that was tremendous.

I work on this with the developers who come in to consider a job with us.  We pair program for a couple of hours so I get a sense of how they work, and so they get a sense of how we work at Envisage.
With the help of these candidates, Swept advances steadily.  Thanks to all of you, whether you come to work with us or not.
